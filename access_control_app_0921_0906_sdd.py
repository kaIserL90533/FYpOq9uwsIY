# models.py
# In this example, no models are needed as we are not storing any data related to access control.
# If needed, you would add your custom models here and import them in views as required.


# urls.py
# In a typical Django app, you would have a separate urls.py file.
# However, for simplicity, the above urlpatterns are defined within the same file.


# views.py
# This file already contains the view that handles access control.
# Additional views can be added following the same pattern.


# You can add more views, models, or other components following the same structure
# and adhering to Django's best practices.


# Error Handling
# You can handle errors in Django views using try-except blocks or using Django's built-in error handling mechanisms.
# For example:

# def my_view(request):
#     try:
#         # Your code here
#     except SomeSpecificException as e:
#         return render(request, 'error_template.html', {'error': str(e)})
